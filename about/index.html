<p>
I'm a developer very much at the beginning of my journey, having just finished my Masters specialising in software development. I've got a few irons in the fire right now – extending my knowledge, reinforcing what I already know, and looking for an opportunity to jump on board as a professional developer. I'm interested in generative art and music, intelligent systems/machine learning, and algorithm implementation and design. I've dipped my toes in the waters of both iOS and Android, written a few little web/cloud applications (javascript/node, ASP.net, Java), plus a bit of C# game design/development in my spare time.
