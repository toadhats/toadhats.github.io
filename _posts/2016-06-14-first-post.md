Having just finished my last semester of my Masters, I'm already feeling a sense of loss at not being incredibly busy eveery day – so I've finally gotten around to setting up the blog I spent the last few months thinking about (but not actually having spare time to do). I'm not entirely sure what the focus is – I guess the aim is to create yet another "developer blog", a place to talk about what I'm doing, probably mainly with the intention of helping my own process, really. I guess we'll see how it develops organically?
