<p>
I'm a developer very much at the beginning of my journey, having just finished my Masters specialising in software development. Right now my fingers are in a lot of pies – extending my knowledge, reinforcing what I already know, and tutoring at Monash University where I studied. I'm interested in generative art and music, intelligent systems/machine learning, and 'competitive' programming. I've dipped my toes in the waters of both iOS and Android, written a few little web/cloud applications (javascript/node, ASP.net, Java), plus a bit of C# game design/development in my spare time.
