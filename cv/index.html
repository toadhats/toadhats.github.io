<h3> Master of Information Technology </h3>
<h4> Monash University </h4>
<p> 2014 â€“ 2016 </p>
<p> I took as diverse a selection of units as possible, ranging from database analysis and design to software security, in an effort to become a well-rounded independent developer while also satisfying my perrsonal curiosity. I'm driven to understand deep structures before I try and build on top of them. This sent me beyond the confines of the curriculum on many occasions, helping me to develop the discipline, insight and creativity required to solve problems independently.</p>

<p>As the 'capstone' of my degree I participated in the Industry Experience Studio Project unit, where I worked as part of a small team to conceive, design and develop an ASP.net web application leveraging open data provided data.gov.au, designed to allow users to identify suburbs or regional towns which have key services and conveniences (like schools, hospitals, sports clubs or disability services) specified by the user. We adopted an agile project methodology, and were privileged to work with 'industry mentors' from Cyara who volunteered their time to act as our product owners and guide us through the process from brainstorming, to 'pitch', to delivery and acceptance testing.</p>
